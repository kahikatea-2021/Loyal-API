## The Coffee Shop Code of Conduct.

# What follows below is the code that we have agreed to conduct ourselves by during this project.

We acknowledge that we all have a common goal on this project.  We are all hoping to produce an application that is of high quality, looks good and has functionality.  Something that we would be proud to put our name to and show to colleagues.

# Wellbeing
This is an important topic for all of us.  We have been very upfront that we recognize people have commitments outside of the course/project and some of these are integral for keeping a healthy balance such as gym sessions or family commitments.  While we all agree that during the course of this project our focus and attention will be here where it needs to be, in order for us to bring our full attention and selves to the table we have agreed people can make space for these important extra curricular activities.

If some one plans to take time away then it is on that person to make sure they have signposted this to the team and that everyone is aware of it.  It is just a simple act of respect for the other team members and one we all agree is the right thing and we are comfortable with it.

# Conflict
We have decided to deal with things on a consensus basis - as a group of 5 this will work well and we have highlighted it is important ot have a chat with between parties to resolve conflict, if we need to have a group discussion about an issue then so be it and then if that fails to bring about resolution we will look to the facilitators for their input and expertise.

# Project management
We will have 2 daily stand ups and an end of day retro to see how we are fairing.  If ad hoc chats are required then they will happen as and when the need arises.  We will manage tasks via a board system in Github.  

# The Process
We all believe it is important that we enjoy ourselves throughout this process.  We are here for each other and there is no judgement, if you need help then do not be afraid to ask for it - there are no silly questions.  If you are not feeling good speak up and say so and we will all pull to help you through that situation.

We recognize that this is a really special time and environment to be working in. We have a team of kind, courteous and talented people who all want nothing but success for each other - keeping that front of mind will help us all reach the finish line with something we are truly proud of.
